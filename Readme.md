# Case Study: Healthcare Appointment Scheduling System

## Overview

This case study involves designing and implementing a microservices-based architecture for a healthcare appointment scheduling system. The system has three main services: Patient Service, Doctor Service, and Appointment Service. The Patient Service manages patient information, the Doctor Service handles doctor information, and the Appointment Service schedules and manages appointments between patients and doctors.

## Requirements

**Patient Service**

    Create Patient: Registers new patients.
    Get Patient Info: Retrieves information about a specific patient.
    Update Patient Info: Updates patient details.

**Doctor Service**

    Create Doctor: Registers new doctors.
    Get Doctor Info: Retrieves information about a specific doctor.
    Update Doctor Info: Updates doctor details.

**Appointment Service**

    Schedule Appointment: Schedules an appointment between a patient and a doctor.
    Cancel Appointment: Allows patients to cancel appointments.
    Get Appointment Info: Retrieves details about a specific appointment.

**Technologies**

- Java for developing the microservices
- Spring Boot for creating standalone, production-grade Spring applications
- MySQL for data storage
- Feign for declarative REST client and synchronous HTTP communication
- RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication between services
- Spring Cloud for building a resilient and scalable microservices architecture
- Spring Cloud Gateway for routing and load balancing
- Eureka for service discovery
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration and managing the deployment

**Architecture**

    Patient Service:
        Exposes REST APIs for creating, retrieving, and updating patient information.

    Doctor Service:
        Exposes REST APIs for creating, retrieving, and updating doctor information.

    Appointment Service:
        Exposes REST APIs for scheduling, canceling, and retrieving appointment details.
        Communicates with Patient Service and Doctor Service to verify availability and details.
        Publishes appointment events to RabbitMQ.

    Service Discovery:
        Uses Eureka for service registration and discovery.

    API Gateway:
        Uses Spring Cloud Gateway to route requests to the appropriate service.

    Asynchronous Communication:
        Uses RabbitMQ for decoupling services and handling events asynchronously.

## System-Wide Constraints

- Data Consistency: Ensure consistency between services by validating data through service-to-service communication.
- Service Availability: Ensure high availability of services using proper load balancing and failover mechanisms.
- Caching: Implement caching to improve performance and reduce the load on the database.
- Security: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive patient and doctor data.
- Data Privacy: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
- Scalability: Design the system to handle increasing loads, using containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for scaling.
- Logging and Monitoring: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to track system performance and troubleshoot issues.
- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages to clients.
- Resilience: Use circuit breakers (e.g., Hystrix) and retries to handle transient failures and ensure system resilience.
- API Rate Limiting: Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage among users.
